    "## How to use: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure all audio files end with the date/time for the file in the format \"xxxxx_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.wav\"\n",
    "1. Edit and run all **Setup** code chunks to prepare the model parameters and file paths for use. \n",
    "  - Note:`#*#` indicates locations where you may want to edit (e.g. file paths, parameter values, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the **Run model** code chunks to run the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data organization \n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes the data is organized such that there is a folder for each year and each year contains folders for each logger and each logger has subfolders for different dates. \n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. This would be the file path for the data from logger 1a in 2022 for the date 2-2-15: \n",
    "\n",
    "`/Volumes/Expansion/Frog Call Project/Calling Data/ichaway/ichaway_2022/1a/2-2-15`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips and troubleshooting \n",
    "   \n",
    "1. This code will take hours to run if you're doing a lot of data! Plug in your computer. Also make sure you computer will not turn off while it is running (you may need to do this in your computer settings). It's ok if the screen turns off, but the computer must continue running. The model saves results at checkpoints, so if it stops for some reason, some of the data will be saved. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To try to make it faster: One option is to open multiple instances of this notebook and run different years and/or loggers seperately. If you do this, make sure the folders labels are different for each piece that is running. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You may get (MANY) warnings that say something like `UserWarning: nperseg = 256 is greater than input length  = 94, using nperseg = 94`. This is fine to ignore - it's just saying the last spectrogram used by the model is shorter because the audio file ended. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. An example for running a univariate parameter exploration is given below, as well. \n",
    "\n",
